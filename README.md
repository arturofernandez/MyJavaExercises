# MyJavaExercises

This is the place where I'm going to publish all my Java Exerceises that I'm doing during my Programing Subject at my Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Technology Engineering.

## How is this repository organized?
I've dividen the repository in 3 tipes of content:
-Units: Here you could find some of the exercises that I've done during the lectures and to prepare exams.
-Partial: Here you could find all the the exercises of the Programing Exams I've done.
